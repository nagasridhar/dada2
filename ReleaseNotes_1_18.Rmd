DADA2 1.18 RELEASE NOTES
-----------------------

#### SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

* The `assignTaxonomy` function is significantly faster.

#### BUG FIXES

* `plotQualityProfile` now appropriately handles y-axis scaling even when some sampes have few reads.

* `derepFastq` gracefully handles zero-length reads in the input.

* The bug introduced in the last release that created (small) differences between the output of `learnErrors(..., multi=TRUE)` and `learnErrors(..., multi=FALSE)` has been fixed.
